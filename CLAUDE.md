# ClaudIA UI — Developer Guide

ClaudIA is a Chainlit-based trading assistant chatbot that connects to Interactive Brokers via `ibkr_core_mcp`. It provides conversational access to IBKR data, backtesting, technical analysis, TradingView integration, and human-confirmed order staging.

---

## Architecture

```
Chainlit UI (localhost:8000)
    ↓
claudia/app.py              — session lifecycle, action callbacks, startup buttons
claudia/agent.py            — Anthropic SDK streaming loop, tool routing
claudia/context_loader.py   — docs/context.md + docs/principles.md → system prompt
claudia/conversation_store.py — SQLite: sessions, messages, decisions, relationships, doc_versions
claudia/gdrive_sync.py      — GDriveSync: download claudia.db at start / upload at stop
claudia/order_flow.py       — cl.Action order staging → ibkr_core_mcp biometric gates
claudia/status.py           — ConnectivityChecker: IBKR/GDrive/TV polling, TCP health
claudia/tradingview.py      — tradingview-mcp sidecar + CDP health + PineScript display
    ↓                               ↓
ibkr_core_mcp               tradingview-mcp (Node.js, stdio)
(local editable install)            ↓
    ↓                       TradingView Desktop (CDP, localhost:9222)
IBKR Client Portal Gateway
(Docker, localhost:5055)
```

**ibkr_core_mcp** is a direct Python import — not an MCP server. The `ClaudeToolkit`
exposes IBKR tools that drop straight into the Anthropic SDK `tools=` parameter.
TradingView tools are merged in from the `tradingview-mcp` Node.js sidecar (curated
15-tool subset by default — see `_CURATED_TOOLS` in `claudia/tradingview.py`).

---

## Market Calendar

`SQLiteStore.get_market_calendar_context()` injects trading-day awareness into ClaudIA's system prompt at every session start. No API calls — pure pre-built library data.

**20 exchanges covered — full G20 + Eurex (current year + next year, past and future holidays):**

Excludes Russia (XMOS — IBKR suspended most Russian securities since 2022 sanctions) and Argentina (XBUE — capital controls, very limited IBKR access). Saudi Arabia (XSAU) trades Sun–Thu; Fridays appear as "closed" from a Mon–Fri perspective — correct, not a data error.

| Code | Exchange | Region | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| `XNYS` | NYSE | US | Primary staleness reference, equity order timing |
| `CME` | CME Futures | US | ES, CL, GC — different hours and holiday set vs NYSE |
| `XLON` | LSE London | Europe | European open/close effects on US pre-market |
| `XETR` | Xetra Frankfurt | Europe | EU macro events, German/EU equity flows |
| `XEUR` | Eurex | Europe | DAX futures, EURO STOXX 50 — EU derivatives benchmark |
| `XPAR` | Euronext Paris | Europe | CAC 40, EU large-cap equities |
| `XMIL` | Borsa Italiana | Europe | FTSE MIB, EU peripheral spreads |
| `XTKS` | TSE Tokyo | Asia | Nikkei, yen carry — first major session after US close |
| `XHKG` | HKEX Hong Kong | Asia | China proxy, Hang Seng, dim sum flows |
| `XSHG` | SSE Shanghai | Asia | China A-shares, direct macro signal |
| `XBOM` | BSE Mumbai | Asia | India — fastest-growing G20 equity market |
| `XKRX` | KRX Seoul | Asia | Samsung, TSMC proxy, semiconductor bellwether |
| `XASX` | ASX Sydney | Asia-Pacific | Iron ore, copper — first market to open globally |
| `XTSE` | TSX Toronto | Americas | Oil sands, gold miners |
| `BVMF` | B3 São Paulo | Americas | Brazilian commodities, EM sentiment |
| `XMEX` | BMV Mexico City | Americas | Nearshoring flows, peso/USD dynamics |
| `XJSE` | JSE Johannesburg | Africa | Mining, platinum group metals |
| `XSAU` | Tadawul | Middle East | Oil policy signal, Aramco flows (Sun–Thu week) |
| `XIDX` | IDX Jakarta | SE Asia | Commodities, EM Asia |
| `XIST` | Borsa Istanbul | EMEA | Macro volatility signal, lira dynamics |

**What ClaudIA receives in the system prompt:**
- Today's date and whether it is a trading day (NYSE reference)
- Last and next trading day
- Full holiday list for all 8 exchanges — proactive context for "why is volume low today?"
- **Futures vs Securities distinction** — explicitly injected so ClaudIA never confuses CME and equity schedules:
  - Most CME Globex products trade ~23h/day (Sun 5 PM CT → Fri 4 PM CT), daily 1h maintenance break 4–5 PM CT
  - IBKR routes all CME products via Globex (electronic only — no pit sessions)
  - **CME open when NYSE is closed**: MLK Day, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Labor Day, etc. — dynamically computed from exchange_calendars each session
- **CME product group schedule** (`_FUTURES_SCHEDULE` in `store.py`):

| Group | Exchange | Globex Hours (CT) | Key products |
|---|---|---|---|
| Equity Index | CME | Sun 5 PM – Fri 4 PM (~23h) | ES, NQ, RTY, YM |
| Energy | NYMEX | Sun 5 PM – Fri 4 PM (~23h) | CL, NG, RB, HO |
| Metals | COMEX | Sun 5 PM – Fri 4 PM (~23h) | GC, SI, HG |
| Foreign Currency | CME | Sun 5 PM – Fri 4 PM (~23h) | 6E, 6J, 6B, 6A |
| Interest Rates | CBOT | Sun 5 PM – Fri 4 PM (~23h) | ZN, ZB, ZF, ZT |
| Agriculture/Grains | CBOT | Sun 7 PM – Fri 1:20 PM (~17h) | ZC, ZS, ZW — closes at 1:20 PM CT, **not 4 PM** |
| Softs/Livestock | CME/CBOT | Varies — shorter than financials | LE, GF, HE, CC |

**Performance (designed for zero marginal cost):**

| Call | Time |
|---|---|
| First call per process (cold) | ~3.4s — exchange_calendars loads numpy arrays for 20 exchanges once |
| Subsequent calls same day | 0.01ms — process-level date-keyed cache hit |
| Next day / process restart | Recomputes fresh — cache key includes today's date |

Cache lives in `_market_calendar_cache` (module-level dict in `ibkr_core_mcp/store.py`). Key: `(date_str, tuple(exchange_codes))` — auto-invalidates at midnight, no manual expiry needed.

**Staleness check** also uses the NYSE calendar: `stale = newest < last_trading_day`. This correctly handles weekends and holidays — no false stale on Saturdays, no missed sync after a holiday Monday.

---

## Trade Data Architecture

Two complementary sources — each covers what the other cannot:

| Source | Tool | Coverage | Latency |
|---|---|---|---|
| IBKR Flex Web Service | `sync_flex_trades` / `get_trades source='store'` | Full history (years), settled trades | T+1 — yesterday at best |
| IBKR Client Portal REST API | `get_trades source='live'` | Last 6 days, today's intraday | Real-time |

Flex never has today's trades. The live API fills that gap.

**Startup sync decision** (in `app.py → _background_flex_sync`):
1. `stale == False` → skip (newest == last NYSE trading day — calendar-aware, not a fixed day count)
2. Last `flex_sync` log entry < 4h ago → skip (recent attempt, avoid API lockout)
3. Otherwise → sync, log result, back up `store.db` to Drive `account_data/`

**Data stores:**
- `~/.ibkr_core/store.db` — SQLite, all Flex-synced trades (1029 rows, 2020-present)
- `data/claudia.db` — SQLite, conversation history, sessions, decisions
- Drive `market_data/` — Parquet OHLCV cache
- Drive `account_data/` — Flex XML archives, `store.db` backup, `trade_coverage.json`

See [`docs/flex-query-setup.md`](docs/flex-query-setup.md) for full setup and troubleshooting.

### Live Orders Two-Call Pattern

`get_live_orders` (and `diagnose_orders`) use a documented IBKR two-call pattern. Per IBKR Campus documentation, `/iserver/account/orders` behaves like `/iserver/marketdata/snapshot`: the first call instantiates the subscription and returns empty/snapshot data; the second call returns the actual live order list.

**Implementation in `client.py`:**
```python
self._get("/iserver/account/orders?force=true")  # instantiate subscription
time.sleep(1)
data = self._get("/iserver/account/orders")       # retrieve actual data
```

Symptoms and diagnosis:
- `orders: [], snapshot: true` on only one call → missing second call, not a data issue
- Still empty after two calls → possible IBKR session not fully initialized; check `ping()` first
- Mobile/TWS-placed orders: expected to be visible after proper initialization (under test)
- GTC orders from previous days: should appear in the live list regardless of when placed

---

### HMDS Warmup Behavior

`fetch_market_data` uses `/hmds/history` (IBKR's Historical Market Data Service). This endpoint has a documented first-call behavior: IBKR initializes a per-symbol data subscription on the first request, which typically returns 404 or 500 while warming up.

**`_fetch_market_data` in `claude_tools.py` handles this with a 3-attempt retry loop (2s delay) on `IBKRAPIError`.** The `with_retry` wrapper in `rate_limiter.py` only covers 429/503 — HMDS warmup errors (404/500) are handled separately at the tool level.

Symptoms and diagnosis:
- First call for a new symbol fails → warmup, auto-retried, transparent
- Subsequent calls for the same symbol → fast (subscription already live)
- Period A fails, shorter Period B succeeds → Period A likely hit the warmup window; Period B ran after it cleared. Not a period-length limit.
- All retries fail → check account/positions endpoints; if those work, it may be an IBKR subscription limit for that lookback or symbol

---

## GDrive Sync

`claudia/gdrive_sync.py` — `GDriveSync` class, auto-enabled when `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` is set. No new env vars required.

### What syncs

| File | Direction | When |
|---|---|---|
| `claudia.db` | Drive → local | Session start (first session per process, before DB opens) |
| `claudia.db` | local → Drive | Session stop (after `close_session`, with WAL checkpoint) |
| `context.md` | Drive → memory | Every session start (overrides local file if present on Drive) |
| `principles.md` | Drive → memory | Every session start (overrides local file if present on Drive) |

### Drive folder layout

```
<GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID>/              ← root ClaudIA folder
  context.md                           ← ClaudIA persona (optional, upload manually)
  principles.md                        ← trading rules (optional, upload manually)
  db/                                  ← GDRIVE_DB_FOLDER_ID (auto-created by GDriveSync)
    claudia.db                         ← conversation history
  market_data/                         ← GDRIVE_CACHE_FOLDER_ID (auto-created by GDriveCache)
    manifest.json                      ← market data index
    AAPL_1D_1Y_2026-01-01.parquet      ← OHLCV cache
    ...
```

Both subfolders are auto-created on first use. Set `GDRIVE_DB_FOLDER_ID` or
`GDRIVE_CACHE_FOLDER_ID` explicitly to point to pre-existing folders instead.

### First-time setup on a new machine

1. Create (or reuse) a Google Drive folder for ClaudIA. Get its ID from the URL:
   `drive.google.com/drive/folders/<FOLDER_ID>`
2. Set `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=<FOLDER_ID>` in `.env`
3. Start ClaudIA — it downloads `claudia.db` (from the `db/` subfolder) on session start.
   Both `db/` and `market_data/` subfolders are auto-created on first use.
4. To enable Drive context/principles: upload `docs/context.md` and `docs/principles.md`
   to the **root** folder via the Drive web UI (not inside `db/`)

### Hot-reload behaviour

Drive texts are fetched once per session start. The watchdog still watches local files — editing `docs/context.md` while a session runs clears the Drive override and uses the local file from the next message.

### Error handling

All Drive operations are non-fatal. On any failure (no token, network error, tampered file):

| Operation | On failure |
|---|---|
| `download_db` at start | Log warning; use existing local `claudia.db` |
| `upload_db` at stop | Log warning; local copy preserved; syncs next session |
| `read_text` for context/principles | Log warning; fall back to local `docs/` files |
| `ping()` (connectivity poll) | Returns `False`; status light turns red; no exception raised |

**Threading note:** `upload_db` uses `threading.RLock` (reentrant) because `_find_file`
calls `_get_service()`, which also acquires the same lock. A plain `Lock` would deadlock
when `upload_db` is called while a session is active.

---

## context.md and principles.md

These two documents define ClaudIA's entire behavior. They are loaded at session start
and injected as the system prompt. **Never commit these files** — they contain your
personal trading rules.

- `docs/context.md` — Who ClaudIA is: its role, persona, areas of expertise, communication style.
- `docs/principles.md` — Your trading rules: risk limits, preferred strategies, instruments, position sizing, red lines.

**Hot-reload:** Edit and save either file while a session is running. ClaudIA will notify
you in chat and apply the new content from the next message onwards.

**Versioning:** On every session start, a SHA-256 hash of both documents is computed. If
the hash is new, it is automatically registered as the next version (`v1`, `v2`, …) in
`claudia.db → doc_versions`, and a human-readable snapshot is written to
`docs/versions/{label}/`. ClaudIA's system prompt always includes the active version label
so it knows which rules are in effect. If the version changed since the last session, a
`WARNING: v1 → v2` alert appears in chat.

ClaudIA has two tools to reason about version history:
- `list_doc_versions` — enumerate registered versions with dates
- `get_doc_version("v1")` — retrieve the full content of any past version to check for contradictions with current rules

Past conversation history retrieved from memory always includes which document version was active,
so ClaudIA can flag if something discussed under old rules conflicts with the current principles.

---

## Conversation Memory

All interactions are stored in `data/claudia.db` (separate from ibkr_core_mcp's `~/.ibkr_core/store.db`).

| Table | Contents |
|---|---|
| `sessions` | One row per Chainlit session, with start/end time, document hash, and `doc_version` |
| `messages` | Full message history (user, assistant, tool calls and results) — primary memory store |
| `decisions` | User-directed trade proposals surfaced by ClaudIA — each tagged with `doc_version`. ClaudIA does not decide to trade; it surfaces a proposal when directed by the user. The user decides at the button → Touch ID → confirmation dialog. |
| `relationships` | Accumulated symbol-level observations built over time |
| `doc_versions` | Versioned snapshots of `context.md` + `principles.md` — full text, hash, date |

**Search:** ClaudIA uses SQLite FTS5 to search full conversation history. Ask: *"What did we discuss about NVDA last month?"* The `search_past_conversations` tool searches all messages across all sessions. Results include the doc version active at the time.

**Version snapshots** are also written to `docs/versions/{label}/` as human-readable files for reference.

---

## Order Staging Flow

ClaudIA **cannot** place orders autonomously. When ClaudIA suggests a trade:

1. ClaudIA outputs an `order-proposal` JSON block in its response.
2. `agent.py` strips the block and calls `order_flow.render_order_proposal()`.
3. A Chainlit message appears with full order details + **"Stage this order"** button.
4. You click the button — `IBKRClient.place_order()` is called directly.
5. **Gate 1:** Apple Touch ID / biometric authentication (macOS LocalAuthentication).
6. **Gate 2:** tkinter modal dialog with order details + 60-second countdown. Enter key disabled.
7. Order is submitted to IBKR only after both gates pass.

---

## Price Alerts

Alerts are managed exclusively through IBKR's native server-side alert system — they fire even when ClaudIA is not running, and appear on the IBKR mobile app.

ClaudIA has four alert tools (via `ibkr_core_mcp.ClaudeToolkit`):

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `create_price_alert` | Resolves symbol → conid, posts alert to IBKR server |
| `get_alerts` | List all configured alerts with status |
| `delete_alert` | Remove an alert by ID |
| `activate_alert` | Toggle an alert on/off without deleting it |

There is no background polling loop in claudia_ui — IBKR delivers the notification directly to the mobile app and desktop.

---

## IBKR Gateway Startup

`start-claudia.sh` is the recommended launcher for a fresh session — it calls
`GatewayManager.startup()` then starts Chainlit.

If you launch `chainlit run claudia/app.py` directly and the gateway is offline,
the welcome message shows a **"Start IBKR Gateway"** action button. Clicking it:

1. Ensures Docker Desktop is running (launches it on macOS if needed)
2. Starts the gateway container
3. Waits up to 120s for the Java process to be reachable
4. Opens `https://localhost:5055` in your browser
5. You complete the IBKR login + 2FA; `ConnectivityChecker` sends the "reconnected" alert

This uses `ibkr_core_mcp.gateway.GatewayManager` — no changes to ibkr_core_mcp needed.

---

## TradingView Integration

**Screenshot analysis (always available):**
Drag or paste any TradingView chart screenshot into the chat. ClaudIA receives it as a
Claude vision content block and analyzes indicators, patterns, and price action.

**Live integration (requires TradingView Desktop):**

The sidecar is [`tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp`](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp)
(78 tools, actively maintained). ClaudIA exposes a curated 15-tool subset by default
to control token cost; the full set is available via `bridge.get_all_tools()`.

Binary discovery order (`_find_tv_mcp_bin()`):
1. `TRADINGVIEW_MCP_PATH` env var (validated: file must exist and end in `.js`)
2. `tradingview-mcp` on PATH
3. `~/.tradingview-mcp/src/server.js` (pure JS layout — current)
4. `~/.tradingview-mcp/build/index.js` (TypeScript build output — legacy)
5. `vendor/tradingview-mcp/src/server.js` (archived fallback, needs `node_modules/`)
6. `vendor/tradingview-mcp/index.js` (legacy single-bundle archive)

If TradingView Desktop is not running at session start, the welcome message shows a
**"Launch TradingView"** action button. Clicking it runs `launch_tradingview()` (macOS
`open -a "Trading View" --args --remote-debugging-port=9222`), polls for CDP port 9222
for up to 30s, then reconnects the MCP sidecar.

**PineScript:** ClaudIA generates PineScript v5 directly. Use the **"Inject into TradingView"**
button to paste it into the Pine Editor via the `pine_set_source` MCP tool.

**Curated 15-tool subset** (`_CURATED_TOOLS` in `claudia/tradingview.py`):

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| Chart reading | `chart_get_state`, `quote_get`, `data_get_ohlcv`, `data_get_study_values` |
| Chart control | `chart_set_symbol`, `chart_set_timeframe`, `indicator_set_inputs` |
| Pine Script IDE | `pine_set_source`, `pine_smart_compile`, `pine_get_errors`, `pine_get_source` |
| Strategy results | `data_get_strategy_results`, `data_get_equity_curve` |
| Utility | `tv_health_check`, `capture_screenshot` |

**Break recovery:** If the sidecar breaks after a TradingView or npm update, see
[`docs/tradingview-mcp-recovery.md`](docs/tradingview-mcp-recovery.md) for the error
signature catalog and recovery steps.

**Vendor archive:** Run `./scripts/archive-tv-mcp.sh` after every verified install to snapshot
the working version to `vendor/tradingview-mcp/`. For the JS layout it copies `src/` + installs
prod deps; for legacy TS it copies the single bundle. ClaudIA automatically falls back to this
archive if the live install at `~/.tradingview-mcp/` is missing or broken.

---

## Connectivity Status

`claudia/status.py` — `ConnectivityChecker` polls three services every 60s:

| Service | Check method | Transitions |
|---|---|---|
| IBKR | `GET /tickle` → parse `iserver.authStatus.authenticated && connected` | Sends "reconnected" / "disconnected" chat alert |
| GDrive | `GDriveSync.ping()` — live `files().list` round-trip | Sends alert on state change |
| TradingView | TCP connect to port 9222 | Sends alert on state change |

**IBKR:** `/tickle` returns HTTP 200 even when the session is not authenticated (e.g. before
login or after timeout). The check parses `iserver.authStatus` from the JSON body and
requires both `authenticated: true` and `connected: true`. Side effect: the `/tickle` call
also resets the IBKR session keepalive timer, so polling every 60s prevents auto-logout.

**GDrive:** `GDriveSync.ping()` is called every poll cycle when Drive sync is enabled. Falls
back to token-file existence check if `GDriveSync` was not wired (e.g.
`GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` not set). The green light reflects real API reachability, not
just credential presence.

The cached status is served by `GET /api/status` (used by the UI connectivity lights).
TradingView status is `UNKNOWN` (gray) when no bridge is configured, `ERROR` (red) when
the bridge exists but CDP port 9222 is unreachable.

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (no IBKR connection needed)
pytest -m "not integration"

# All tests (requires live IBKR gateway)
pytest
```

## API Reference — Docs First

**Never assume API behavior, error codes, endpoint paths, or field names from memory. Always verify against official documentation first. This applies to every external API claudia_ui touches.**

**Protocol:** Use `WebFetch` to load the relevant doc page before writing any error message, fix, or diagnosis. Cite the source URL in the error string and in the commit message.

This rule exists because two bugs in one session were caught instantly by checking the official docs — and had gone undetected for months because nobody checked:
- Flex error 1001 mislabeled twice (rate limit → auth failure → actually transient generation failure)
- Flex endpoint URL wrong from day one (`gdcdyn` vs `ndcdyn`) — Flex API never worked until the doc was read

## Hard Rules for Developers

These rules must never be violated when extending ClaudIA:

1. **Never add a tool that calls `place_order`, `modify_order`, `cancel_order`, or `reply_order`.**
   Order staging is a UI-layer action triggered by a physical button click, not an LLM tool call.

2. **Never log or expose `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** in Chainlit output, logs, or error messages.

3. **Never modify the hardcoded safety block** in `claudia/agent.py` to weaken constraints.

4. **Never inject conversation history directly into the system prompt.** History must be
   added as `role: user/assistant` message objects to prevent prompt injection.

5. **ibkr_core_mcp is read-only from claudia_ui's perspective.** Never bypass `ClaudeToolkit`
   to call `IBKRClient` directly from within an LLM tool handler.

## ibkr_core_mcp Dependency

`ibkr_core_mcp` is installed as a local editable package:
```
pip install -e "../ibkr_core_mcp"
```

When updating ibkr_core_mcp (e.g. after adding new tools), re-run `pip install -e "../ibkr_core_mcp"`.
No restart of the Chainlit app is needed for tool definition changes; restart required for
Python module changes.

Tools planned for ibkr_core_mcp:
- `preview_order` — read-only whatif order preview (in `ibkr_core_mcp/claude_tools.py`)
- `get_pnl` — real-time partitioned P&L (in `ibkr_core_mcp/claude_tools.py`)
